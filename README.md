# Naive_Bayes_Classifier

About the project: In this project, we have a data set taken from Kaggle (Rotten Tomatoes Reviews),
 which has two columns Freshness and Review. We have a total of 480000 records in our dataset. On which we try to apply the naive bayes classifier and find the probability.

Pre-requisites: This does not require any installations as the project is built on jupyter notebook. 


How to run the project:

Open Jupyter notebook.
Pull the code.
Download the dataset from 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/rotten-tomatoes-reviews' and upload it to jupyter.
